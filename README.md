# MINI CODING PROJECTS
## Guess the number
The computer will generate a random number from a to b.
Both a and b being typed in by the user.
The user will continue guessing and will be told if the guess is too high or too low until their guess is correct

## Computer guesses the number
The user will input a lower and higher bound of numbers for the computers to guess from. Then the user will choose a number that the computer will have to continue to guess until correct. If the computer's guess is too high or too low the guessing bounds will be adjusted accordingly.
